3) **Assumptions**  
1. The backorder status will be displayed in the "Status" of the Invoice.  
2. The interaction with CC Bank is an external system behavior and is not modeled within the database.  
3. The minimum inventory level for triggering automatic ordering varies for each product. Therefore, by comparing the Quantity\_On\_Hand with the Min\_Inventory in Product, we can determine whether to trigger the automatic order placement.  
4. By checking whether the Last\_Sale\_Date in the Product is more than four weeks old, we can determine whether the product should be scrapped.  
5. When the product is scrapped, its information still remains in the database.
